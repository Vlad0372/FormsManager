# FormsManager
This application is based on a default Larabel "chirper" project template.

The aim was to immitate forms managing. You can fill in an application form, save it, edit it, print it as PDF. Also you have access to adding, editing and deleting additional form types (for example add a form type, which has an addition field "Place description"). The types will be available for others too. There is also session mechanism implemented in the application. You have a certain amount of time to finish filling your application form, only after the user finishes his form it becomes available for other users.

Generally it was my first project written in Laravel framework. There were a lot of new cool stuff to work with.
